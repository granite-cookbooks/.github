# About Granite Cookbooks

Welcome to the IBM Granite Community for IBM's [Granite Model Family](https://www.ibm.com/granite).

IBM is building enterprise-focused foundation models to drive the future of business. The Granite family of foundation models span a variety of modalities, including language, code, time series, and science (e.g., materials).

The _Granite Cookbooks_ provide open-source "recipes" for using these models in various practical scenarios. The first recipes will focus on [Granite Code models](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-code-models-6624c5cec322e4c148c8b330):

* [`granite-code-cookbook`](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-code-cookbook)

Other cookbooks are planned for time series, materials, and language.
